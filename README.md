## 👋 Welcome

Hi, I'm **Cesar (YABX)**. Welcome to the **Data Warehouse Project**!

This repository serves as a portfolio and documentation of my journey in expanding my understanding of **SQL**, **Data Architecture**, and **Business Intelligence**. Here, I apply warehousing principles to build end-to-end analytic solutions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights. I am simulating a real-world scenario where data must be consolidated from disparate sources to support business decision-making.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
1.  **Data Engineering:** Build a robust data warehouse using **SQL Server**.
2.  **Data Analytics:** Create SQL-based reports to analyze Customer Behavior and Product Performance.

## 🛠️ Architecture & Requirements

### 1. Data Engineering (Building the Warehouse)
The core of this project involves consolidating sales data into a unified structure.

* **Data Sources:**
    * **ERP System:** Source 1 (CSV Format)
    * **CRM System:** Source 2 (CSV Format)
* **Data Quality:** Implementation of cleaning procedures to resolve inconsistencies and quality issues before analysis.
* **Integration:** Merging ERP and CRM data into a single, user-friendly data model.
* **Scope:** Focused on the **latest dataset** (Snapshot model); Historical data versioning (SCD) is out of scope for this iteration.
* **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation of the schema for stakeholders and analytics teams.

### 2. Business Intelligence (Analytics & Reporting)
Once the data is modeled, I develop SQL queries to extract insights.

* **📊 Customer Behavior:** Analyzing purchasing patterns and customer segmentation.
* **📈 Product Performance:** Tracking sales volume, revenue, and product trends.
